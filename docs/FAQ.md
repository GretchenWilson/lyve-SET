Can I have multiple reference genomes?
======================================
No.  However, you can add multiple assemblies to the asm directory.  Assemblies don't have the same error profile as reads and so you might expect some skew in the ultimate phylogeny.

How do I choose a reference genome?
===================================
The best reference genome for an outbreak is something in-clade.  You might even need to assemble the genome from your own reads before starting.  An outgroup is not as related to your clade by definition and so it is probably not the best genome to use.  The next best quality is a closed genome, or a genome with a high N50.
